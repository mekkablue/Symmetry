# Symmetry.glyphsReporter

This is a plugin for the [Glyphs font editor](http://glyphsapp.com/) by Georg Seifert. In Edit view, it displays a soft yellowish, mirrored image of the current glyph behind the paths, so you can check if a design is truly symmetrical.

After installation, it will add the menu item *View > Show Symmetry*. You can set a keyboard shortcut in System Preferences.

### Installation

1. Download the complete ZIP file and unpack it, or clone the repository.
2. Double click the .glyphsReporter file. Confirm the dialog that appears in Glyphs.
3. Restart Glyphs

### Usage Instructions

1. Open a glyph in Edit View.
2. Use *View > Symmetry* to toggle the preview of the instances.

### Requirements

The plugin needs Glyphs 2.2 or higher, running on OS X 10.9.5 or later. I only test it in current OS and app versions, and I assume it will work in older app versions too, but I cannot guarantee it.
